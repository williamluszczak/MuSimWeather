# MuSimWeather
This is a set of scripts that will take in a set of files containing information about the atmospheric density field, and return maps of the average muon flux as a function of elevation for a user-provided detector location.

Prerequisites (will add version numbers later):
- Geopy (https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- MCEq (https://github.com/mceq-project/MCEq/tree/master)
- Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Scipy (https://scipy.org/)
